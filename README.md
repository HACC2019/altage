# Altage

Altage is a user-friendly web application implemented with Salesforce that solves the problem that Hawaiian Electric faces with regards to its EV charging stations placed around the State of Hawaii. Using the historical and trending data provided by Hawaiian electric, the application will provide a more elaborate insight on the health of a given charging station, congestion at a given charge station and the electric load of a DC fast charging station.
